#Minimal Modern Hopfield Example

This is the bare minimum hopfield example using ascii art and using the hopfield model as a classifier.

You can inject noise into the source and it has a roughly 90% accuracy at 20% noise and a 50% accuracy at 40% noise.

This is for low fidelity ascii art so I feel like that is quite good.
